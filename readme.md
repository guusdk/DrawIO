DrawIO is a plugin for openfire that wraps the draw.io web service (war file) found [here](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/releases)
This plugin was created in response to an issue on Pade reported [here](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Pade/issues/73).

The intention is to make this version of draw.io become a collaborative diagraming tool when used with Pàdé and Openfire Meetings.
